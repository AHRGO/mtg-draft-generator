# My Magic: the Gathering draft booster generator
Here is an simple application to reuse your cards and generate a "draft booster" and play draft again.

I made this for my Commander Legends Battle for Baldur's Gate collection, so, if you want to draft another set, you might need to do some changes.

*I hope to implement the feature to draft standarts sets in the future*

# How to use it?
Im really newbie yet, but you can paste this code on any js runner (including your browser), and it will return some numbers.
Im using it this way: I separated my cards into a common, uncommon, rares/mythic rares and foil cards in faced down piles. 
Then, based on the numbers given by the generator, I get that many cards from each pile and in the end add a foil card.

Its simple and maybe silly, but it works :)
